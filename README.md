## 📊 Key Insights Discovered

### Model Performance Rankings
1. **LightGBM**: Best overall (MAE: ~2.3)
2. **Poisson**: Good for zero-inflation patterns
3. **Linear Regression**: Reliable baseline
4. **Moving Average**: Simple but effective
5. **Naive**: Baseline comparison

### Critical Findings
- **Local Model Failure**: 3.45 billion MAE (excluded from analysis)
- **Seasonal Contradictions**: Summer sales exceed winter expectations
- **Weekend Effect**: Significantly underestimated in initial models
- **SNAP Impact**: 18.7% average sales increase on benefit days

### Pattern Analysis Results
- **Zero Inflation**: 62% of daily sales are zero
- **Volume Concentration**: 90th percentile products have 10x median sales
- **Seasonal Patterns**: 35-40% sales increase during summer months
- **SNAP Effects**: Measurable on 33% of calendar days

## 🧪 Testing

The dashboard includes a comprehensive test suite:

```bash
